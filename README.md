AI Document Q&amp;A Assistant is a simple end-to-end RAG app that lets users upload PDFs and ask questions about them. It uses FastAPI, FAISS, and OpenAI embeddings/LLMs to retrieve relevant chunks and generate accurate, citation-based answers. A Streamlit UI provides an easy chat interface for interacting with the documents.
